# pmxplore developer's notebook

## To do 
 * [] Add testing of all functions

 * [] Adding missing_flag argument to all plot functions? (to enable exclude that from the plots/print them as NA/missing)

 * [] generate azTheme

 * [] Follow up on variableList for data structure function - finalized with Dheeraj but is the file being generated? 
   
## Datasets included with package:  
* [] Something is weird/wrong with BW in the existing PK dataset. 
* [] Might be good to include one additional dose level in this example. Also include NOMTIME, and time-varying covariates. +Date and time?

* [] Create dataset with large range of dose groups to test the dose proportionality functions

* [] Create NONMEM output file to use with r_data_staructure(..., nm=T)
